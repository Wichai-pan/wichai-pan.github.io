# Workshop 7 Tracking

Colourful ball bouncing off walls
Using the pygame library, the following video clip can be generated

## Step1: Identification
• Before being able to track the ball, we must identify it
• This mean learning its appearance
• Use (r, g) in the normalised RGB colour space

• The PNG image for the colourful ball is on Blackboard
• Read the image, create an array for the (r, g) space
• For each pixel of the ball, populate the array
• Normalise the (r, g) space to make it a probability density function
(PDF)
• The PDF will be the colour model for your ball

## Step 2: extracting frames
• You are given a video clip for the ball bouncing in the constraint
environment
• Extract all frames and save them in a FRAMES folder

## Step 3: tracking
• Using the alpha-beta tracker, track the ball throughout the video
• What you need to do is to detect where the ball is in the first frame
• The ball in the image should be the same size of the ball in the
video and the frames
• So, you can use template matching to search for its first position
• You then define a bounding rectangle for the ball
• In the minimal alpha-beta tracker, you can use a fixed bounding
rectangle, its position and a constant velocity
