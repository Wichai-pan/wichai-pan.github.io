# Project development processes

## Development approaches

> A development approach is the means used to create and evolve the product, service, or result during the project life cycle.[. . . ] Three commonly used approaches are predictive,
>
> <u>hybrid</u>, and <u>adaptive</u>.



## A spectrum of approaches

### Choice of a development approach

**1.** project variables (stakeholder, time, and cost) 

**2.** organization (structure, culture, policies, size) 

**3.** outcome (product, service, or result)

​	▶ degree of innovation 

​	▶ clarity of requirements 

​	▶ stability of scope

​	▶ inherent risk

​	▶ safety requirements

​	▶ relevant regulations
