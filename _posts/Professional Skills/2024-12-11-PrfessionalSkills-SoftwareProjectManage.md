# Managing software projects



## What is a project?

> A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. {: .prompt-tip }

A project must have

▶ **beginning** and **end** 

▶ clear **goal**



## The golden/iron/project triangle

▶ QUALITY: non-functional requirements 

▶ SCOPE: functional requirements

▶ COST: budget/human constraints

▶ TIME: delivery constraints

**Model:** SCOPE = TIME × COST

**Difference:** All constraints are now in RESOURCES



## What is software engineering?

Engineering is about getting results of the required qual- ity within schedule and budget. This often involves making compromises—engineers cannot be perfectionists.

Software engineering = management of software projects

Core **hard skills**, but **soft skills** are also involved!



## Summary

**2.** What falls under SCOPE? *Functional requirements.*

**3.** What falls under RESOURCES? *All constraints (COST* *and* *TIME).*

**4.** What is SOFTWARE ENGINEERING?*Techniques for managing software projects.*
