TO EMBASSY OF Spain:

Dear Sir/Madam,

Hope this email finds you well!

I am writing to provide additional information regarding my Schengen visa application for a trip to Spain, scheduled from 6/1/2025 to 12/1/2025.

I understand the importance of demonstrating my financial capacity to cover my expenses during my stay. While I have provided my bank statements for the past three months, you may notice a significant deposit made on 9/12/2025. I would like to explain the source of this deposit to provide full transparency:

1. **Reason for the Recent Deposit**:
   - The amount of Â£1600 was transferred from my bank card in China(Bank of China) in pounds sterling cash, and my family transferred enough RMB to my account before I came to study in the UK.
   - The funds were added to ensure that I have ample financial resources for my planned trip to Spain.
2. **Additional Evidence of Financial Stability**:

- My regular income and financial habits (as shown in the last three months' statements) show that I maintain financial responsibility, I will exchange pounds in China, withdraw cash, deposit in HSBC.
3. **Details of my trip to Spain**:

- I have planned my trip, including a brief description of planned activities, accommodation, etc.
- I have made all reservations as shown in the attachment (e.g. flight tickets, hotel reservations).

I hope that this explanation and the documents provided will resolve any concerns about my financial situation. If further clarification or additional documents are required, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Best regards,

Huatai Pan
