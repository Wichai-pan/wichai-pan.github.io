# Machine Learing

Machine learning algorithms can be classified according to

- the type of problems they solve
- the model they use
- the way they learn



## Types of problems

- classification
  - output of the model is a discrete set of categories
    - examples:
      - spam detection
      - pion/proton discrimination
      - positive/negative COVID test
- regression
  - output of the model is a continous variable
  - examples:
    - value of stock
    - country GDP



The boundary between the two types can be blured:

- when the categories have an ordering we can use regression and bin the result into categories
  - A*, A, B, C, ... grades
  - number of stars for a review
  - energy rating of a building
- for classification we can fit a function for the probability of belonging to one class



## Types of learning

- supervised learning
  - we have a training set with labelled examples
- unsupervised learning
  - no labelled examples
  - model has to find features
  - can be used as a first step before supervised learning
  - dimensionality reduction
    - many features
    - need to find the most relevant ones as input to supervised learning model



## Learning modes

- batch learning
- online learning
- mini-batch

### Batch learning

The entire training set is used for each iteration of the model optimisation

### Online learning

The model is updated for each new training example.

### Mini-batch

The model is optimised for subsets of the training set

## Instance based vs Model based

- instance based
  - uses examples to learn
  - need "similarity" measure to compare new data to training data
- model based
  - we use a model to quantify the relationship between the data
  - the data fixes the parameters of the model



Example: predicting final grade $g_4$ of a student given their 1st, 2nd and 3rd year result $g_1$, $g_2$ and $g_3$.

- instance-based:

  - look at historical results and find the student who has the closest marks to the student we want to predict the result from
  - use the final grade of the past student as the prediction for the new student
  - could look at a set of historical students and average

- model-based:

  - we can hypothesize a linear dependency:

  $$
  g_4 = c_1g_1+c_2g_2+c_3g_3
  $$

  

  - fit the coefficients $c1$, $c_2$, $c_3$ to historical data and use them to predict the new student's final grade.





## Examples of model-based algorithms

- linear models
  - perceptron
  - logistic regression
  - SVM (support vector machine)
  - ...
- non-linear models
  - polynomial features
  - neural networks
  - ...

## Examples of instance-based algorithms

- $k$-neighbour
- SVM with RBF kernel
- ...
