## Learning outcomes

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to
- Explain the importance of feedback control in general and digital control in particular
- List the advantages and disadvantages of digital control
- Explain the implications of converting continuous-time into discrete-time models
- Derive and use the properties of Laplace transforms to represent continuous-time systems


## A simple example: controlling the speed of a car

- We have a car (we call it **the system** or **the plant**)
- We have the motor torque and brakes (we call it the **input signal**)
- We have the speed (we call it the **output signal**)
- We have the feet that press the gas and brake pedals (we call it **the controller**)
- We have a reference speed (we call it the **reference signal**)

- The controller computes the input signal  $u(t)$ that lets the output signal  $y(t)$ follow the reference signal  $r(t)$
- Solution without feedback ( [open-loop control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-loop_control_system) ) relies on constant conditions
- **But what happens if the road slope changes (disturbances)?**


- We need to adapt to slope changes (disturbances )
- So, we need some information about the speed feedback
- The controller takes slope changes (disturbances) into account by observing the speed (feedback )
- This solution is with feedback (closed-loop control)

![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210551623.png)

- $r(t)$ input to the controller (left block: clutch, brake, accelerator)
- Controller output $u(t)$ to the car (middle block: blue car)
- Disturbance $d(t)$ acting on the car (red arrow)
- Output $y(t)$ is the speed observed (right block: speedometer)
- Feedback path from output back to controller

- Ideally, we want to automate this process  
→ [Automatic control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_control)
- In cars, this is often implemented in the form of cruise control systems



## Why do we need feedback control systems?

### Open-loop system

```
reference point → Controller → Plant → plant output
```

- A controller can be adjusted to give the right output
- Works provided there are *no disturbances*!
![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210609127.png)

### Closed-loop systems

- Deviations from the reference point are corrected *automatically*

## Application areas of control engineering

## From analog to digital control

- *Classical* and *modern* control theory for [continuous-time control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory#Continuous-time_control) systems has revolutionized industrial processes (a few years ago)
- Treating systems in continuous time in theory requires immediate feedback, *e.g.*, when the feedback loop is implemented in hardware
![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210641530.png)


- In practice, nowadays, controllers are typically implemented on microprocessors

## Why are we interested in digital control?

- Digital computers and microprocessors offer tremendous amount of **flexibility and versatility in the design approach**
- For some applications, **better system performance** can be achieved with digital control system design
- Digital control uses **digital communication**:
  - More reliable due to its improved noise immunity
  - Better resolution when representing numbers
![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210651792.png)


## Disadvantages/problems of digital control?

- Complicated controllers implemented in software may have **software errors**
- Most control processes are analog in nature:
  - Signal from digital controller → converted to analog (D/A converter) – hold
  - Signal to the digital controller → converted to digital (A/D converter) – sampling
  - Converting signals can cause **information loss**
![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210718531.png)



- **A/D and D/A converters introduce some time-delay** → performance objectives may be difficult to achieve
- Mathematical analysis sometimes more complex

## Discrete-time controller design

**There are 2 main design approaches**  
- Discretize the analog controller  
![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210731851.png)

- Discretize the process and do the entire design in discrete time  
![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210738523.png)


## To think about…

- The system contains both analog and discrete signals (hybrid system). How do you treat these kinds of systems analytically?
- Are the traditional time-domain and frequency-domain methods useful in this context? Can they be modified?
- How do you design digital controllers? What should be taken into account in the implementation?
- Is it so that a digital controller only imitates the corresponding analog controller and the result is somewhat worse then (due to losing information in discretization)?
- Do discrete-time systems have properties that the corresponding analog systems do not have?

## Example: controlling the arm of a disk drive
![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210748888.png)

- The dynamics of relating the position *y* of the arm to the voltage *u* of the drive amplifier is *approximately* described by the transfer function

  $$
  G(s) = \frac{k}{Js^2}
  $$

  where *k* is a constant and *J* the inertia.
- A servo-controller is given by

  $$
  U(s) = K \frac{b}{a} U_c(s) - K \frac{s + b}{s + a} Y(s),
  $$

  where *u_c* is the reference signal.
- Discretize the analog servo controller to obtain a digital one!
- To obtain a digital controller, the servo controller is first re-written:

$$
U(s) = K \left( \frac{b}{a} U_c(s) - Y(s) + \frac{a - b}{s + a} Y(s) \right) = K \left( \frac{b}{a} U_c(s) - Y(s) + \mathbf{X(s)} \right)
$$

- Transforming it to the time domain, we obtain

$$
u(t) = K \left( \frac{b}{a} u_c(t) - y(t) + x(t) \right)
$$

- We also need an expression for  $x(t) $
- We know

$$
X(s) = \frac{a - b}{s + a} Y(s)
$$

- We can rewrite this

$$
sX(s) + aX(s) = (a - b) Y(s)
$$
$$
\frac{\text{d} x(t)}{\text{d} t} + a x(t) = (a - b) y(t)
$$


- From the previous slide, we have

$$
\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = -ax(t) + (a - b)y(t)
$$

- To obtain a discrete-time controller, we approximate the derivative:

$$
\frac{x(t + T_s) - x(t)}{T_s} = -ax(t) + (a - b)y(t)
$$

- Hence, we obtain the following approximated discrete controller:

$$
u(t_k) = K\left(\frac{b}{a} u_c(t_k) - y(t_k) + x(t_k)\right)
$$

$$
x(t_k + T_s) - x(t_k) = T_s(-ax(t_k) + (a - b)y(t_k))
$$
![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210809714.png)

- Deadbeat control: bring output to steady-state in minimal number of time steps
- Control strategy used has a somewhat similar form as the previous controller

$$
u(t_k) = a_0 u_c(t_k) + a_1 u_c(t_{k-1}) - b_0 y(y_k) - b_1 y(t_{k-1}) - c_1 u(t_{k-1})
$$


![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210824236.png)

- Settles much quicker than continuous-time controller
- Output reaches desired value without overshoot
- We will study this concept in Lecture 9 
- Such a control scheme cannot be obtained with a continuous-time controller!


## Recap: Laplace transform

- The Laplace transform is very similar to the Fourier transform
- The Laplace transform often simplifies the analysis of continuous-time systems
- For example, the Laplace transform transforms differential equations into algebraic equations and convolutions into multiplications
- For these reasons, analog systems are often designed and analyzed using the Laplace transform 
![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210842509.png)


- Advantages  
  - Provides a complete solution  
  - Much less time is involved in solving the differential equations  
  - Initial conditions are automatically considered in the transformed equations  
  - It provides a systematic and routine solution for differential equations  

## Definition of the Laplace transform


### **Laplace transform**

> The Laplace transform  $X(s) $ of a function  $x(t)$, for  $t > 0$, is defined by
> $$ \mathcal{L} \{ x(t) \} := X(s) = \lim_{T \to \infty} \int_{\tau=0}^{T} x(\tau) e^{-s\tau} \, \mathrm{d}\tau, $$
> where  $s $ is a complex number.


- There are **3 main tools for obtaining Laplace transforms**  
  - The definition  
  - Laplace transform properties  
  - Lists of transforms of known functions  
- In what follows, we will study the 3 approaches


## From the definition

- Here, we use the definition (with slight abuse of notation) directly  
  $$
  X(s) = \int_{t=0}^\infty x(t) e^{-st} dt
  $$

- Example 1: consider the function $x(t) = 1$:  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}\{1\} = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} dt = \left[-\frac{1}{s} e^{-st}\right]_0^\infty = \frac{1}{s}
  $$

- Example 2: consider the function $x(t) = e^{at}$, where $a$ is a constant:  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}\{e^{at}\} = \int_0^\infty e^{at} e^{-st} dt = \int_0^\infty e^{-(s-a)t} dt = \left[-\frac{1}{s-a} e^{-(s-a)t}\right]_0^\infty = \frac{1}{s-a}
  $$

- Example 3: consider the function $x(t) = t$ (for a reminder on integration by parts, see the appendix):  
  $$
  \mathcal{L}\{t\} = \int_0^\infty t e^{-st} dt = \left[-\frac{1}{s} t e^{-st}\right]_0^\infty + \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{s} e^{-st} dt = \frac{1}{s^2}
  $$
## From properties of the Laplace transform

Linearity   
$$
\mathcal{L}\{af(t) + bg(t)\} = a\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} + b\mathcal{L}\{g(t)\}
$$

Derivative   
$$
\mathcal{L}\{f'(t)\} = sF(s) - f(0)
$$

Frequency shifting   
$$
\mathcal{L} \left\{ e^{at} f(t) \right\} = F(s - a)
$$

Convolution   
$$
\mathcal{L}\{(f * g)(t)\} = F(s)G(s)
$$

De Moivre’s   
$$
\mathcal{L}\{ \cos(at) + j \sin(at) \} = \mathcal{L} \left\{ e^{jat} \right\} = \frac{1}{s - ja} = \frac{s}{s^2 + a^2} + j \frac{a}{s^2 + a^2}
$$

$$
\mathcal{L}\{\cos(at)\} = \frac{s}{s^2 + a^2}
$$

$$
\mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \frac{a}{s^2 + a^2}
$$

Final value theorem   
$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} f(t) = \lim_{s \to 0} sF(s)
$$

Initial value theorem   
$$
f(0) = \lim_{s \to \infty} sF(s)
$$

## In-class exercise

Find the voltage *y* of the capacitor in the circuit below, provided  $y(0) = 0$.
![image.png](https://wichaiblog-1316355194.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/20250913210900377.png)

**Reminder**

- **Capacitor:**

$$
i(t) = C \frac{dV(t)}{dt}
$$

- **Resistor:**

$$
V(t) = Ri(t)
$$

(Note: The circuit diagram shows a voltage source $u$, a 1 Ω resistor, and a 1 F capacitor with voltage $y$.)

## Laplace transform – closing remarks

- The Laplace transform can help with analyzing continuous-time systems
- It is **not** applicable to discrete-time systems!
- For discrete-time system, a similar transform exists: the z-transform
- More on this in the next lecture
  

# Learning outcomes

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to  
- Explain the importance of feedback control in general and digital control in particular  
- List the advantages and disadvantages of digital control  
- Explain the implications of converting continuous-time into discrete-time models  
- Derive and use the properties of Laplace transforms to represent continuous-time systems

# Appendix

## Integration by parts

- Recall the chain rule for differentiation

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}(vu)}{\mathrm{d}t} = v \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}t} + u \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}
$$

- If we integrate both sides with respect to  $t $, we get

$$
\int \frac{\mathrm{d}(vu)}{\mathrm{d}t} = \int v \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}t} + \int u \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}
$$

- Rearranging

$$
\int v \frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}t} = uv - \int u \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}
$$

- This gives us a useful way of integrating products

# Partial fractions

- Many equations involving rational expressions can be solved easier if partial fraction decomposition is done beforehand  
- Assume a rational expression of the form  

  $$
  f(s) = \frac{P(s)}{Q(s)}
  $$

  where both $P(s)$ (numerator) and $Q(s)$ (denominator) are polynomials and the degree of $P(s)$ is smaller than the degree of $Q(s)$  
- **Note:** partial fraction decomposition can only be done if the degree of the numerator is strictly less than the degree of the denominator

## Partial fractions

| **Factor in denominator**      | **Term in partial fraction decomposition**                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| $(as + b)$                  | $\rightarrow \frac{A}{as+b}$                                  |
| $(as + b)^k$                | $\rightarrow \frac{A_1}{as+b} + \frac{A_2}{(as+b)^2} + \cdots + \frac{A_k}{(as+b)^k}$ |
| $(as^2 + bs + c)$           | $\rightarrow \frac{As + B}{as^2 + bs + c}$                    |
| $(as^2 + bs + c)^k$         | $\rightarrow \frac{A_1 s + B_1}{as^2 + bs + c} + \frac{A_2 s + B_2}{(as^2 + bs + c)^2} + \cdots + \frac{A_k s + B_k}{(as^2 + bs + c)^k}$ |

## Examples:

$$
\frac{P(s)}{(as^{2} + bs + c)(ds + e)} \rightarrow \frac{As + B}{as^{2} + bs + c} + \frac{C}{ds + e}
$$

$$
\frac{P(s)}{(as + b)^{2}(ds + e)} \rightarrow \frac{A}{as + b} + \frac{B}{(as + b)^2} + \frac{C}{ds + e}
$$
