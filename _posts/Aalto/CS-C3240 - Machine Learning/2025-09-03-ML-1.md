## Overview

### 3 types of ML
- Supervised learning 
	- Classification
	- Regression
- Unsupervised learning
	- Clustering 
		- Scatter plot
	- Dimensionality reduction 降维
- Reinforcement learning

### Outline of the course

## Basics

### Data matrix


### Feature vector

### Histogram

### Text as a vector

1. "It is sunny outside"
   =>[1 1 1 1 0 0 0 ...]
2. "yesterday it was cloudy"
   =>[1 0 0 0 1(yes) 1 1 0]
3. "Is it nice, is it not?"
   =>[2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0]

### tf-idf text representation
??


### Neural network -based text representations
