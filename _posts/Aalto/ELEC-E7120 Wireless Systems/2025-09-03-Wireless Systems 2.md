# Wireless Systems 2 Cellular concept and architecture of a mobile network




stand alone PPT is wrong


| Wireless System                | Frequency band of operation                     | Transmission Power (order of magnitude)                   | Transmission Method                      | Estimated Range of Operation                     | License required? |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **LTE & NR (Mobile Networks)** | 700 MHz, 1800 MHz, 3.5 GHz, mmWave (26–39 GHz)  | Base station: tens of Watts; UE: 0.2–1 W                  | OFDMA (DL), SC-FDMA (UL)                 | Hundreds of meters (urban) to tens of km (rural) | Yes               |
| **Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1)**  | 2.4 GHz ISM band                                | 1–100 mW                                                  | FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) | ~1–10 m                                          | No                |
| **GPS**                        | 1.2–1.5 GHz (L1/L2/L5 bands)                    | Satellites: hundreds of Watts; receivers: passive (no Tx) | CDMA (spread spectrum)                   | Global coverage                                  | No (receivers)    |
| **Wi-Fi (802.11ac)**           | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz ISM                              | ~100 mW                                                   | OFDM                                     | ~30–100 m                                        | No                |
